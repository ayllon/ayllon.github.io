After a bit more than four years and a half, I left the Astronomy Department of the
University of Geneva. It has been a great pleasure working there.

Since the 1st of November, I now work at SonarSource, on the C-Family (C, C++, and Objective-C) analyzer.

Funny thing, during my work at UNIGE, I often hit false positives for rule [S4962](https://rules.sonarsource.com/cpp/type/Bug/RSPEC-4962):
"`nullptr` should be used to denote the null pointer."

![]({{baseurl}}/img/2022/nullptr.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

There is no pointer in that expression! Well, it turns out there is, for a default parameter on `boost::any`,
a parameter with the default value of `0` for a pointer. This message also appears with some boost python functions/classes.

Indeed, this is a false positive. This smell is the callee problem, not the caller.

I got to work on this one and fix it. It was enjoyable because it annoyed me in the past ðŸ˜„.
