## Why blogging
Writing is not precisely one of my strong suits. If I am going to try
doing a PhD, and having to write, eventually - hopefully - a thesis, I better
improve at it.

Since the only way of improving at something is actually doing it, I'll try
to blog about curiosities I find on my day to day work, and also about stuff
I find, consider, think, do... about the thesis. Additionally, this may
be helpful along the road when I need step back to write a paper.

Anyhow, this is just for my own consumption!

## Jekyll
I have decided to go along with Jekyll. Markdown is easy enough to focus
only on the writing. Besides, keeping it in Git in plain text is a great plus,
not to mention code highlight support!

I am using the great [The Plain](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) theme,
by [Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi) with a couple of small changes.
I find it pleasingly simple and straight forward.
