title: I agree

Yesterday someone said I am really fast at fixing bugs, something I have been told in the past too
at a different job. Curiously, today I find via Reddit this article:

[Ten Reasons Why You Fix Bugs As Soon As You Find Them](https://ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-archive/lessons/ten-reasons-why-you-fix-bugs-as-soon-as-you-find-them)

And, as the title says, I agree with it, and that is why I tend to jump into bugs as soon as they are
found (provided I do not have anything more urgent on the plate, of course).

I should write more, by the way. Always the same thing, times goes fast and, when I want to realize, months have passed by since the last time I did.
