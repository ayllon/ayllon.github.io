title: I am a terrible person
---

2018 is gone, and I only wrote two entries. Two! And one of them about
soap. I am really bad at keeping a blog.

It is true that I do keep notes using a [Jupyter journal]({%post_url 2018/2018-04-12-jupyter-journal%})
now, but I did not intend to abandon this. I was serious when I said
that [I needed to write to become better at writing]({%post_url 2017/2017-02-08-starting_a_blog%}).

I will not bother promising I will be better at this during 2019. In all
likelihood, I will not.

In any case, talking about writing, I got a paper published in IEEE Access!
[Interactive Data Exploration of Distributed Raw Files: A Systematic Mapping Study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882244).
A Q1 publication (for 2017), so I am quite happy about it. Besides, it is a requirement
for the PhD program, so that's one tick more towards completion. Hooray!
