title: I got my PhD! 🎉 🎓
---

I [started the blog]({% post_url 2017/2017-02-08-starting_a_blog %}) precisely
to get used to writing. A bit over six years after (😮‍💨).

It worked out, and I finally defended [Navigating Diverse Datasets in the Face of Uncertainty](https://rodin.uca.es/handle/10498/29364)!

So there is that, now I have a PhD degree on Computer Engineering by the
[University of Cádiz](https://escueladoctoral.uca.es/doctorate/doctorate-programme-courses/computer-engineering/?lang=en).
