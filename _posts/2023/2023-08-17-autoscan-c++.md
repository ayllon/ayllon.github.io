title: SonarCloud's automatic analysis for C++
---

[ðŸš€ SonarCloud's automatic analysis for C++ is live!](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/no-c-static-analysis-does-not-have-to-be-painful/)

Even though I joined just in [November 2022]({% post_url 2022/2022-11-30-sonar %}), I have had the chance to work on "C++ AutoScan" for most of 2023.

It has been a great experience to learn about the CFamily analyzer from top to bottom, and about clang's frontend, [which is used by Sonar's CFamily analyzer](https://llvm.org/Users.html).
