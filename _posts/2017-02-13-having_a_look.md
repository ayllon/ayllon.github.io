## Having a look
I have had an initial look to have an idea on how many papers are we talking
about for the SLR/SMS. However, I haven't had much luck with the terms I
have been trying, so I have taken a different approach.

I have gone to the latest issues of some, I think, relevant
[Journals of Impact](https://jcr.incites.thomsonreuters.com) and look for
which keywords paper that seem interesting use.

Let's see if this helps for the SLR.

* P2P/peer to peer
* access performance
* replica placement
* workflow (seems to be popular, although more for scheduling)
* distributed and parallel data management
* distributed cache
* data distribution
* storage

And maybe, additionally

* SDN
* data granularity (?)

What can I look for? Maybe how many studies there are? Which solutions/approaches
have been proposed, and how mature they seem to be?

So many questions!
