title: Windows 11 and `NUL`
---

We had a bug report complaining that we were leaving a bunch of `NUL.o` files on disk.
The user had a Windows 11 machine, and we had never had complaints before.

In Windows, `NUL` is a special file, treated as a reserved name for a special
device file that discards all data written to it. [This behavior dates back to MS-DOS](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031022-00/?p=42073). An application can "create" and "write" 
to a `NUL` file (or variations like `NUL.txt`, `NUL.o`, etc.), but in reality, the file is never
actually created on disk, regardless of the underlying filesystem.

Many applications, including ours, rely on this fact when we need a command that requires
an output file to dump its output "nowhere."

Let's create a simple Python script to test this:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory


def create_file(path: Path):
    try:
        with open(path, "w") as f:
            f.write("1234567890\n")
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error creating file '{nul}': {e}")


def list_files(path: Path):
    print("\nList of files:")
    for file in path.iterdir():
        stat = os.stat(file)
        print(f"\t{file} {stat.st_size} bytes")


with TemporaryDirectory(delete=False) as tempdir:
    tempdir = Path(tempdir)

    nuls = ["nul", "NUL", "NUL.o", "NUL.o:", "NUL:.o", "\\.\\NUL"]
    for nul in nuls:
        path = nul if nul.startswith("\\") else tempdir / nul
        create_file(path)

    list_files(tempdir)
```

## Windows 10

If we run this on Windows 10, we get:

```
> python .\nulpy.py

List of files:
```

So, no errors, and no files persisted, as we would expect.

Note that I have also added a device path: `\.\NUL`, which is a "device path" pointing
to the `NUL` device.

## Windows 11

In Windows 11, however, the behavior has changed:

```
PS C:\Users\Alejandro\nul-py> python .\nulpy.py
Error creating file 'NUL.o:': [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'C:\\Users\\ALEJAN~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpwa3xxhbs\\NUL.o:'

List of files:
        C:\Users\ALEJAN~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpwa3xxhbs\NUL 0 bytes
        C:\Users\ALEJAN~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpwa3xxhbs\NUL.o 12 bytes
```

First, `NUL.o:` is not accepted and causes an error.
Second, `NUL` and `NUL.o` files are created! More specifically, `NUL.o` is created by opening, well,
`NUL.o`. It has a size of 12 bytes, which means the bytes actually landed on disk.

However, and quite surprisingly, the empty `NUL` is **not** created by any of the first two
entries. It is created when writing to `NUL:.o`. In this case, the data is thrown away ü§∑üèø.

In our case, using the device path did the trick, since the tool (a compiler, as you may have
guessed) luckily did not try to add `.o` when specifying it, because opening `\.\NUL.o` is an error.

Microsoft has documented reserved filenames and device paths in Windows
([Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions)),
but I have not been able to find any explicit documentation describing this change in behavior.
