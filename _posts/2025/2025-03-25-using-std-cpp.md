title: Using std::cpp 2025
---

I had a presentation on the 19th of March at ["Using std::cpp 2025"](https://eventos.uc3m.es/119554/programme/using-std-cpp-2025.html), which took place at UC3M.

The talk was [C++20 Modules Support in SonarQube: How We Accidentally Became a Build System](https://github.com/ayllon/sonarqube-modules/releases/download/using_std_cpp_2025/ModulesSonarqube.pdf), with the abstract:

> C++20 introduced modules over four years ago, but it has taken some time for compilers and build systems to fully support them. As of late 2023, the situation has improved, and modules are starting to be more appealing to use in practice.
> 
> To add to the momentum, we have recently added support for C++ Modules in SonarQube. In this talk, we will share our experiences and challenges in implementing this support, and discuss how we effectively became a small build system in the process.

It went well! At least, as far as I am concerned. Daniela Engert spotted an error I made on a slide (I had `export import` written on an implementation unit, which does not make any sense ðŸ˜…), but otherwise, it was a good conversation starter later on, during the rest of the conference. I usually have a hard time starting conversations with people I do not know, so that helped make the conference more engaging and fun for me. Sure, I had to go through the stress of doing the presentation, but that saved me the stress of starting conversations later on!
