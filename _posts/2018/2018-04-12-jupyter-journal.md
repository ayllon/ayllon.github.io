title: Jupyter for keeping a journal
---

It has been almost three months since the last entry. I haven't found
anything really interesting to write about, even considering I have
changed jobs and everything.

Probably I should write something about what I am learning at the
observatory, which is a lot.

Anyways, this entry is just to say that I had been looking for a way
of keeping a daily (more or less) journal: from plain text files edited
via `vim`, to specific applications - as RedNotebook -, including, of course,
the present medium.

I discarded the "blog" from the beginning, as the major of the content
would (and is) just random and half-connected paragraphs, about what
I have to do, what I understood I have to do, etc.

And then, I used a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to
test a couple of things on a Python notebook, together with some notes
about my thinking. And I saw it was good.

It is brilliant! Not only can I write down notes in plain text (or
rather markdown), but also insert pieces of code *and* run them.
Even better, the result of the execution - also images and
formulas written in Latex - can be seen on the Github repo where I am
committing the notes.

These notes can be useful not only for myself, but I can also pass
them along so others can see them, again, including pieces of code,
plots and the like.

How didn't I come with this before?!
