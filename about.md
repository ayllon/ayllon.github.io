title: About me

Hello, hola, salut,

I am a Software Engineer working at CERN. I am the lead of the "File Transfer
Service", which outsources the transfer scheduling from three
out of four LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb), and some other
non-LHC experiments.

I have experience in developing and maintaining server side software,
using mostly C, C++ and Python.

To a lesser extent, I have some experience with Go, which we are using on
a side project on our team.

However, I don't like to put myself into "<Insert Language Here> Developer"
buckets. I consider my job to be more than that.

Software is more than just code.

It is dealing with requirements, finding compromises, offering solutions and
ideas. It is finding how components fit together,
deciding on APIs, agreeing with the rest of the team... and then, of course,
shape these ideas as code, take a step back and see if it fits the image
we had developed during the discussions, with the proper balance of
quality, performance, and time spent.

Code is a very important part of the process, but not the only one.
Even more, the less code we can write to reach a solution, the better.
